# Sheet Excavator

## Direct Download and Install
Users can download the .whl file directly from the repository and install it using pip.

Note that the release is only compatible with Python 3.12 on win_amd64.
The library is still in alpha, so the functionality is very limited.
```
pip install https://github.com/kkollsga/sheet_excavator/blob/main/wheels/sheet_excavator-0.1.14-cp312-none-win_amd64.whl?raw=true
# or upgrade an already installed library
pip install --upgrade https://github.com/kkollsga/sheet_excavator/blob/main/wheels/sheet_excavator-0.1.14-cp312-none-win_amd64.whl?raw=true
```
